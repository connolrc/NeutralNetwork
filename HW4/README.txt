current wjk for problem 1 (from the HW3 autoencoder): 
    29 epochs after HW3
    starting further training
    normalizes fucking everything after each image, 
    takes forever
    stoch = .3, alpha = .3 or .4, eta = .001, 
    rho_target = .04, gamma = 1, lagrange = .001

did 3 more epochs with
    stoch = .5, alpha = 6, eta = .001, 
    rho_target = .04, gamma = 1, lagrange = .001
    Jq = 0.172518
