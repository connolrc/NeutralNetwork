Homework 2


My submission contains four .py files. Keep everything in the same directory when running.
These programs also require access to the random, math, and matplotlib Python module 



------ DataOrganizer.py ------

The first file is DataOrganizer.py. This is the file I used to create the datasets of images and 
labels from the homework data files provided for us. 

If you are checking to see if I did so correctly, run this first, and make sure to have the data 
files in the same directory as where you run this file from. 

If you are using your own data sets, skip this file. However, you will have to adjust my other
code files to use your .txt files' names for it to work. 



------ functions.py ------

This file contains much of the fundamental functions I wrote and used as steps for completing 
the homework objectives. This file is imported to the following two files described below, 
problem1.py and problem2.py, to be used in this way. There is also the TestResults() class 
definition in this file, which I used in problem1.py. 

You do not need to run this file at all. Just make sure it is kept in the same direcory as 
problem1.py and problem2.py for access. 



------ problem1.py ------

In this file, I completed the deliverables for Problem 1 of the homework. There are two more
functions defined here that are specific to problem 1. 

Run this file to get the plots and figures for Problem 1 that I generated for my report. 



------ problem2.py ------

This is the file in which I completed the deliverables for Problem 2. There is a modified 
version of the TestResults() class for perceptrons specificially that is defined in this file, 
as well as a Perceptron() class. 

Run this file to get the plots and figures for Problem 2.
