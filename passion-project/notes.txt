- Autoencoders don't have weight biases?
    - wait okay no there must be still...
- rho calculation is very different between autoencoder of hw3p2 and whatever hw4p2 is

AUTOENCODERS ARE hw3p2 and hw4p2

Classifier.py's adjustWeights() function needs to be looked at intensely.   
    - like why is backprop parameter a thing? Isn't it supposed to always be doing that in hw4p1
